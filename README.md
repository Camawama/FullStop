# 🛑 Full Stop! 
Speed thrills, but it hurts. Expect the unexpected! 

NOTICE: This mod is in Alpha. There will be many bugs! Please report all bugs on the issue tracker!

 
## Overview
Full Stop! introduces a new level of challenge to your Minecraft experience by simulating the dangers of velocity and impact. With every sprint, jump, and fall, you'll face realistic consequences that will keep you on your toes. This mod is inspired by [Collision Damage by fonnymunkey](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/collision-damage) and was a fork of [Velocity Based Damage Deluxe by kawaiicakes](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/velocity-based-damage-deluxe).

 
## Features (strikethrough means it hasn't been implemented yet)
- 💥 Dynamic Damage System: Experience realistic damage based on speed and collision force. Deal more damage when moving toward a target and less when moving away. Sudden impacts can leave you reeling. 
- 🛠️ Durability Scaling: The damage you deal affects the durability of your items, meaning every hit counts. 
- 🌪️ G-Force Effects: High-velocity maneuvers can inflict blindness and nausea as you push the limits of your movement. 
- 🔄 Knockback Mechanics: Running into players or walls won't just hurt—~~you'll both be sent flying in the opposite direction. ~~
- ~~🌊 Environmental Challenges: Encounter pressure damage when submerged underwater and~~ experience slowness upon hard landings. 
- ⚠️ Bounce Physics: Collide with walls at sharp angles to be knocked away realistically, adding a tactical element to movement. ⚠️
 

## Planned Features/Known Bugs
- Fix and refine config
- Implement equal and opposite force transfer
- Make it so that hitting a block at extreme velocities breaks the block
- Implement pressure damage deep underwater
- Add checks for spectator mode
 
🚧 Warning 
Speed is your enemy! Will you navigate the perils of movement, or will you fall victim to the forces of nature?
